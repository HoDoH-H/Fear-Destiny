  description: "Ignisorb is a small yet formidable Pok\xE9mon known for its fiery
    crown and rugged, rock-like body. It constantly radiates intense heat from the
    flames atop its head, making it a challenging Pok\xE9mon to approach. Despite
    its small size, Emberock has a feisty personality and can unleash powerful bursts
    of fire when threatened."
