  description: "Geocko is a small, reptilian Pok\xE9mon known for its rocky tail
    and tough, stone-like skin. Its body is primarily a dull gray-blue, allowing
    it to blend in with rocky environments. Geocko's tail is composed of solid rock,
    which it uses both for defense and to deliver powerful attacks against its foes.
    Despite its tough exterior, Geocko is quick and nimble, often darting between
    rocks to avoid larger predators."
